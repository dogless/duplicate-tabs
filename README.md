duplicate-tabs
==============

A simple chrome extension to add a "duplicate tab" hotkey.

Silly chrome does not have a hotkey to duplicate current tabs, so either you right click the tab with your mouse and click "duplicate", or you do a (for Macs) Command + L, Command + C, Command + T, Command + V, Enter. FIVE KEYSTROKES. Way to much. 

Now just do Ctrl + D !

Instructions
------------
- Clone repository
- Open the Chrome Extensions under the Chrome Settings
- Load unpacked extension and point it to the directory of this repository
